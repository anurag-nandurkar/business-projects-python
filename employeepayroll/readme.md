# Employee Payroll System

## Overview

The **Employee Payroll System** is a simple Python-based application that allows you to manage employees' payroll information. It enables the addition of employee details such as hours worked and hourly rate, calculates the salary (including overtime), and generates a payroll report. The system supports exporting the payroll report to a text file.

### Key Features
- Add employee details (name, hours worked, hourly rate)
- Calculate regular and overtime pay
- Display payroll reports in the console
- Export payroll reports to a text file

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For the backend logic
- **Flask (Optional)**: Web framework to build a UI (optional addition for the future)
- **Text File Export**: Export the payroll report to a `.txt` file

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/payroll-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd payroll-system
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

### Running the Application

1. To run the application in the terminal:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to add employee details. The system will display the payroll report in the terminal, and you can export it to a `.txt` file.

### Exporting the Report

Once you've added employee details, you can export the payroll report by running the system, which will generate a text file `payroll_report.txt` with the details.

## Future Enhancements

- **Web Interface**: This system currently runs in the terminal. However, a **Flask-based web interface** can be added for a more interactive user experience. The Flask app will allow users to enter employee details via a form and display the payroll report on a web page.
- **Data Persistence**: Integrate a database (like SQLite) or use CSV/JSON to save and retrieve employee data.
- **Additional Features**: 
  - Employee management features like editing and deleting records.
  - Advanced reporting (e.g., graphs, detailed salary breakdown).
